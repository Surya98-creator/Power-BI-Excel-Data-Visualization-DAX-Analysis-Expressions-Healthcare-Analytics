## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an **advanced Power BI dashboard** to analyze *Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)* data for healthcare analytics.  
It provides meaningful insights into **patient engagement, satisfaction, and retention** through visualizations and KPIs.

The dashboard integrates data-driven storytelling for healthcare executives — enabling better decision-making around patient outcomes and digital health adoption.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Track **Active Users** to evaluate patient engagement in remote monitoring programs.  
- Measure **Drop-Off Rate (%)** to identify patient adherence challenges.  
- Monitor **Feedback Scores** to assess user satisfaction and overall experience.  
- Use **data hierarchies (Year → Month → Day)** for advanced temporal analysis.  
- Build an **executive-level KPI view** summarizing critical performance indicators.

## 🧩 Data & Tools Used
**Dataset Fields:**  
`Date`, `Active Users`, `Drop-Off Rate (%)`, `Feedback Score`, and `Data Sync Frequency`

**Tools:**
- 🧮 **Excel** — Data cleaning, normalization, and formatting  
- 📊 **Power BI** — Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation  

**Visuals Implemented:**
- Line Chart (Engagement Over Time)  
- Dual-Axis Combo Chart (Drop-Off vs Feedback)  
- KPI Cards (Total Users, Avg Drop-Off %, Avg Feedback Score)  
- Date Hierarchy (Year, Month, Day)
